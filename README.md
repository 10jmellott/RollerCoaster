##description##
```
You will create a
rollercoaster track along which the camera will move. You will include an
environment for your rollercoaster; this may be a simple skybox, or may also
include a terrain (using your heightmap code?) or other scenery. You may
use the GLUT toolkit for interaction with the mouse and keyboard to give
the user interactive control over rotation of the camera or other control over
the motion / view.
